# RLS Implementation Summary

## ✅ Task Completed: 3.2 Implementasi Row Level Security policies

This document summarizes the Row Level Security (RLS) policies that have been implemented for the Academic Insight PWA.

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Tables with RLS Enabled

All four main tables have RLS enabled:

- ✅ **profiles** - User profile information
- ✅ **students** - Student academic data  
- ✅ **courses** - Course information and lecturer assignments
- ✅ **grades** - Student grades for courses

### 2. Comprehensive RLS Policies

#### Profiles Table Policies
- `authenticated_users_can_view_profiles` - All authenticated users can view profiles
- `users_can_update_own_profile` - Users can only update their own profile
- `users_can_insert_own_profile` - Users can create their own profile during registration

#### Students Table Policies  
- `authenticated_users_can_view_students` - All authenticated users can view students
- `only_admins_can_insert_students` - Only admins can add new students
- `only_admins_can_update_students` - Only admins can modify student data
- `only_admins_can_delete_students` - Only admins can delete students

#### Courses Table Policies
- `authenticated_users_can_view_courses` - All authenticated users can view courses
- `lecturers_can_manage_own_courses` - Lecturers can manage their assigned courses, admins can manage all
- `only_admins_can_create_courses` - Only admins can create new courses

#### Grades Table Policies
- `lecturers_can_view_their_course_grades` - Lecturers can view grades for their courses, admins can view all
- `lecturers_can_insert_their_course_grades` - Lecturers can add grades for their courses, admins can add all
- `lecturers_can_update_their_course_grades` - Lecturers can update grades for their courses, admins can update all
- `lecturers_can_delete_their_course_grades` - Lecturers can delete grades for their courses, admins can delete all

### 3. Role-Based Access Control

The system implements two user roles:

- **admin**: Full access to all data and operations
- **dosen** (lecturer): Limited access based on their assigned courses

### 4. Security Helper Functions

- `is_admin()` - Check if current user is admin
- `is_course_lecturer(course_uuid)` - Check if user is lecturer for specific course  
- `get_user_role()` - Get the role of current user

### 5. Audit System

- **audit_logs** table to track all changes
- Automatic audit triggers on students, courses, and grades tables
- Only admins can view audit logs

### 6. Performance Optimizations

- Indexes created for RLS policy performance:
  - `idx_profiles_user_role` - For profile role checks
  - `idx_courses_lecturer_id` - For course lecturer checks
  - Additional indexes on commonly queried fields

## 🧪 Testing Implementation

### Test Files Created

1. **supabase/tests/rls_policy_tests.sql** - Basic SQL tests for RLS policies
2. **supabase/tests/rls_integration_tests.sql** - Comprehensive integration tests with user context simulation
3. **supabase/tests/rls-policies.test.ts** - TypeScript/JavaScript tests using Supabase client
4. **supabase/tests/run-rls-tests.js** - Node.js test runner for automated testing
5. **supabase/tests/run-rls-tests.sh** - Bash script for Unix systems

### Test Scenarios Covered

- ✅ Admin users can access all data
- ✅ Lecturers can only access their assigned courses and related grades
- ✅ Users can only update their own profiles
- ✅ Unauthorized access is properly blocked
- ✅ Utility functions work correctly
- ✅ Audit logging functions properly

### How to Run Tests

```bash
# Using npm script
npm run test:rls

# Using Node.js directly
node supabase/tests/run-rls-tests.js

# Using SQL directly (if psql is available)
psql $SUPABASE_DB_URL -f supabase/tests/rls_policy_tests.sql
```

## 📚 Documentation Created

1. **supabase/RLS_POLICIES_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Comprehensive documentation of all RLS policies
2. **supabase/RLS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - This summary document

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### Defense in Depth
- RLS policies as primary security layer
- Application-level validation as secondary layer
- Audit logging for accountability

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Users only get minimum required permissions
- Lecturers limited to their assigned courses
- Admins have full access but actions are audited

### Data Protection
- All sensitive operations require authentication
- Role-based access prevents unauthorized data access
- Audit trail for all data modifications

## ✅ Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the specification:

### Requirement 8.1 (Security)
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) implemented in Supabase
- ✅ JWT token authentication
- ✅ Automatic session management
- ✅ Access logging and monitoring

### Requirement 8.5 (Data Protection)  
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Secure data handling practices
- ✅ Audit trail for data changes

## 🚀 Next Steps

The RLS policies are now fully implemented and tested. The next tasks in the implementation plan can proceed with confidence that:

1. Data access is properly secured
2. User roles are enforced at the database level
3. All data operations are audited
4. Performance is optimized with appropriate indexes

## 📝 Migration Files

The RLS implementation is contained in these migration files:

- `001_create_profiles_table.sql` - Profiles table with RLS enabled
- `002_create_students_table.sql` - Students table with RLS enabled  
- `003_create_courses_table.sql` - Courses table with RLS enabled
- `004_create_grades_table.sql` - Grades table with RLS enabled
- `005_create_utility_functions.sql` - Helper functions
- `006_create_rls_policies.sql` - All RLS policies
- `007_additional_security.sql` - Audit system and additional security features

## 🎯 Summary

The Row Level Security implementation is **complete and production-ready**. It provides:

- ✅ Comprehensive security policies for all tables
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin vs lecturer)
- ✅ Extensive test coverage
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ✅ Audit logging
- ✅ Complete documentation

The system is now secure and ready for the next phase of development.
